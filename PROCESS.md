## **tue 5 june**: 
*	created proposal.

## **wed 6 june**: 
*	created design file
*	got a better understanding of the web audio API

## **thu 7 june**:
*	been busy with finding a new way to let the user use their own music since I found out that Soundcloud is not giving any API's anymore. The conclusion: I want to give the users a playlist and the possibility to upload mp3 files.

## **fri 8 june**: 
* 	presentations

## **sat 9 june**: 
*	had some difficulties with uploading mp3 files since those are local files. The solution for this is downloading a Chrome Extention so a local server can be created.
* 	adjusted frequency barchart.

## **mon 11 june**: 
due to illness I couldn't work on the project

## **tue 12 june**: 
*	created upload function
*	improved position html elements

## **wed 13 june**: 
* 	created update-barchart function which takes the input of uploaded mp3 file.
*	created shape visualization 	
*	circles added based on wavelength
* 	I am considering making a shape-transition visualization because that might be 			cooler
*	I am having problems with putting both visualization in my html: it's hard to make functions out of the audio element which leaves me with 2 audio elements.. so I have to work on that!

## **thu 14 june**
*	created the extra functions so both charts are linked to the same audio element
*	made sure that both charts are updated when mp3 file is uploaded

## **fri 15 june**
*	presentations
*	started with synthesizer

## **mon 18 june**
*	still busy with the synthesizer, had some difficulties understanding it. Read a lot

## **tue 19 june**
*	synthesizer finally works!! In a test file. Now I want to implement a reset button since the manipulation of the song doesn't sound as an improvement yet. I guess I should also pracitce to make it sound like something.

## **wed 20 june**
*	had some troubles with the reset button of the synthesizer

## **thu 21 june**
*	implemented synthesizer with the rest of the charts

## **fri 22 june**
*	charts are updated when synthesizer is used! yes :) I have my MVP now. 3 visualizations: the barchart, circlechart and synthesizer. atm I am in doubt whether I should make a metronome or a linegraph so I will have an extra visualization.

## **mon 25 june** 
*	read into css grid and gridded my page. frequency barchart keeps causing me problems by not scaling well. 

## **tue 26 june**
*	scale fixed and bootstrap installed

## **wed 27 june**
*	lay-out day, cleaned code, might implement a line graph.. not sure if i will have enough time. problems the tidyness of my github.. :( 

## **thu 28 june**
*	last day! wrote the report, cleaned my github and code, added linegraph
